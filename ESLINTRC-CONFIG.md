# Cypress ESLint Plugin - Legacy Config

This document previously described how to use the Cypress ESLint Plugin (`eslint-plugin-cypress`) with an [ESLint legacy config environment](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files-deprecated).

This form of configuration was deprecated with the release of ESLint `v9` and its use with `eslint-plugin-cypress` is no longer supported.

Users who were previously using a deprecated configuration environment should migrate to a [flat configuration](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files).
